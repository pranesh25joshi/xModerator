# 🌈 Installing xModerator on Arc Browser

Arc Browser is fully supported! Since Arc is built on Chromium, the installation process is simple and the extension works perfectly.

## 📥 Installation Steps

### Method 1: Developer Mode (Recommended)
1. **Download** the latest `xmoderator-KEYWORD-CUSTOM-v1.0.9.zip` from the repository
2. **Extract** the zip file to a folder on your computer
3. **Open Arc Browser** and type `arc://extensions/` in the address bar
4. **Enable Developer Mode** (toggle in the top right)
5. **Click "Load unpacked"** and select the extracted folder
6. **Done!** The extension icon should appear in your Arc toolbar

### Method 2: Chrome Web Store (Future)
Once published, you'll be able to install directly from the Chrome Web Store since Arc supports Chrome extensions.
